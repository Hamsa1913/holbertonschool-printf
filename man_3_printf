PRINTF(3)                 Library Functions Manual                 PRINTF(3)

NAME
       _printf - custom implementation of printf function

SYNOPSIS
       #include "main.h"
       int _printf(const char *format, ...);

DESCRIPTION
       The _printf() function produces output according to a format string.
       This function writes output to stdout, the standard output stream.
       
       The format string is composed of zero or more directives:
       - Ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to output
       - Conversion specifications that fetch and format arguments
       
       Supported conversion specifiers:
       %c    Prints a single character
       %s    Prints a string of characters
       %%    Prints a literal percent sign
       %d    Prints a signed integer in decimal base 10
       %i    Prints a signed integer in decimal base 10
       %b    Prints an unsigned integer in binary base 2

       Just because it's in print doesn't mean it's the gospel - this is a
       custom implementation for educational purposes and may not handle
       all edge cases like the standard printf function.

RETURN VALUE
       Upon successful return, the function returns the number of characters
       printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).
       
       If an error occurs, the function returns -1.

EXAMPLES
       The following example demonstrates basic usage:
       
       #include "main.h"
       
       int main(void)
       {
           int count;
           
           count = _printf("Hello, %s!\\n", "world");
           _printf("Printed %d characters\\n", count);
           _printf("Binary of 5: %b\\n", 5);
           _printf("Percent sign: %%\\n");
           
           return (0);
       }

       This would output:
       Hello, world!
       Printed 14 characters
       Binary of 5: 101
       Percent sign: %

BUGS
       This is a custom implementation for Holberton School and may not
       handle all features of the standard printf function.
